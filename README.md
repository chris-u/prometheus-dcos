# [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) on [Mesosphere DC/OS](https://dcos.io/)

## Intro
This runs Prometheus on DC/OS (1.8+). `server.json` contains the service definition for Prometheus itself. `node_exporter.json` contains the service definition for node_exporter. I'm running node_exporter inside a Mesos (cgroups) container so that it sees all of the hosts filesystems without any need for priviliges or translation.

To make life easier I also created a `group.json` that includes the Prometheus Server, Node Exporter, [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), [Grafana Dashboard](https://github.com/lloesche/prometheus-grafana-dcos) and an [authentication proxy](https://github.com/lloesche/auth-proxy-dcos) which will add Basic Auth to the Server's WebUI. The group assumes you're running [Marathon-LB](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-lb) on your DC/OS and exports Marathon-LB labels.

To get started just install the group as shown below.

## Usage
Install using
```
$ dcos marathon group add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lloesche/prometheus-dcos/master/group.json
$ dcos marathon app update /prometheus/node-exporter instances=7000 # however many agents you have in your cluster
```

*Important:* Once the apps are deployed make sure to update all Environment Variables with something useful. Alternatively download group.json and modify them directly before deploying to DC/OS.

When working with the `group.json` you'll want to adjust the following variables and labels:

| App | Variable | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`/prometheus/server` | `EXTERNAL_URI` | The complete URL your Prometheus Server will be reachable under (http(s)://...)|
|`/prometheus/server` | `PAGERDUTY_HIGH_PRIORITY_KEY` | A PagerDuty API Key for High Priority Alerts|
|`/prometheus/server` | `PAGERDUTY_LOW_PRIORITY_KEY` | A PagerDuty API Key for Low Priority Alerts|
|`/prometheus/server` | `SMTP_FROM` | Sender Address Alert Emails are send from|
|`/prometheus/server` | `SMTP_TO` | Recipient Address Alert Emails get send to|
|`/prometheus/server` | `SMTP_SMARTHOST` | SMTP Server Alert Emails are send via|
|`/prometheus/server` | `SMTP_LOGIN` | SMTP Server Login|
|`/prometheus/server` | `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP Server Password|
|`/prometheus/auth-proxy` | `LOGIN` | Login Users have to provide when accessing Prometheus Server|
|`/prometheus/auth-proxy` | `PASSWORD` | Password Users have to provide when accessing Prometheus Server ([following this scheme](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html#auth_basic_user_file))|
|`/prometheus/grafana` | `GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL` | The complete URL Grafana will be reachable under |
|`/prometheus/grafana` | `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` | Grafana Admin Login|
|`/prometheus/grafana` | `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Grafana Admin Password|

| App | Label | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`/prometheus/auth-proxy` | `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` | Hostname Prometheus Server should be reachable under. This is what's contained in `EXTERNAL_URI`|
|`/prometheus/grafana` | `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` | Hostname Grafana should be reachable under. This is what's contained in `GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL` |

## Why file_sd based discovery?
Prometheus supports DNS based service discovery. Given a Mesos-DNS SRV record like `_node-exporter.prometheus._tcp.marathon.mesos` it will find the list of node_exporter nodes and poll them. However it'll result in instance names like
```
node-exporter.prometheus-6ms1y-s1.marathon.mesos:14181
node-exporter.prometheus-54eio-s0.marathon.mesos:12227
node-exporter.prometheus-1e1ow-s2.marathon.mesos:31798
```
which is not very useful. Also the Mesos scheduler will assign a random port resource.

So after a [discussion on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/prometheus-developers/ydww-vzG0IE) it turned out that Prometheus can't relabel the instance with the node's IP address since name resolution happens after relabeling. It was suggested to use the file_sd based discovery method instead. This is what the `srv2file_sd` helper is for. It performs the same SRV and A record lookup and instead of the hostname writes the node's IP addres into the targets file. There's also relabeling taking place to replace the random port number with the node_exporter standard port 9100 so that when a node_exporter is restarted on a different port it's data is still associated with the same node.

## Environment Variables
| Variable | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|
|`NODE_EXPORTER_SRV` | Mesos-DNS SRV record of the node_exporter | `NODE_EXPORTER_SRV=_node-exporter.prometheus._tcp.marathon.mesos`|
|`CADVISOR_SRV` | Mesos-DNS SRV record of cadvisor | `CADVISOR_SRV=_cadvisor.prometheus._tcp.marathon.mesos`|
|`SRV_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (optional) | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SRV_REFRESH_INTERVAL=60`|
|`ALERTMANAGER_URL` (optional) | AlertManager URL - uses buildin AlertManager if not defined | `ALERTMANAGER_URL=prometheusalertmanager.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9093`|
|`ALERTMANAGER_SCHEME` (optional) | AlertManager Scheme - uses http if not defined | `ALERTMANAGER_SCHEME=https`|
|`PAGERDUTY_*_KEY` (optional) | Pagerduty API Key for Alertmanager. Name in * will be made into the severity | `PAGERDUTY_HIGH_PRIORITY_KEY=93dsqkj23gfTD_nFbdwqk` |
|`RULES` (optional) | prometheus.rules, replaces the version that ships with the container image | `RULES=... Entire prometheus.rules file content`|
|`EXTERNAL_URI` (optional) | External WebUI URL | `EXTERNAL_URI=http://prometheusserver.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9090`|
|`STORAGE_TSDB_RETENTION` (optional) | Storage TSDB Retention \ `STORAGE_TSDB_RETENTION=7d`|
|`SMTP_FROM` | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SMTP_FROM=alertmanager@example.com`|
|`SMTP_TO` | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SMTP_TO=ops@example.com`|
|`SMTP_SMARTHOST` | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SMTP_SMARTHOST=mail.example.com`|
|`SMTP_LOGIN` | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SMTP_LOGIN=prometheus`|
|`SMTP_PASSWORD` | How often should we update the targets JSON | `SMTP_PASSWORD=23iuhf23few`|

To produce the $RULES env variable it can be handy to use something like
```
$ cat prometheus.rules | sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\n/\\n/g'
```

## Building the SRV lookup helper
To run the `srv2file_sd` helper tool inside the minimal prom/prometheus Docker container I statically linked it. To do so yourself install [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/) and compile using:
```
$ CC=/usr/local/musl/bin/musl-gcc go build --ldflags '-linkmode external -extldflags "-static"' srv2file_sd.go
```

## Bugs
All this was hacked up in an afternoon. Surely there's bugs. If you find any submit a PR or open an issue.

## TODO
- perform A lookups in parallel instead of looping over all hosts sequentially
